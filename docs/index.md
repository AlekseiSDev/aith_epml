# Wine Quality EPML Project

Welcome to the documentation for the Wine Quality ML Engineering project.

This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline for wine quality prediction, incorporating best practices in MLOps, including:

- **Data Versioning:** Using DVC for tracking datasets and models.
- **Pipeline Automation:** Using Luigi for orchestrating tasks.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Tracking metrics and parameters.
- **Documentation:** Automated documentation with MkDocs (Docs-as-Code).
